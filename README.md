  ## Game Idea : Infinite Wanderer
  * ### Components of roguelike
  * * Randomly generated enounters
  * * No/few longterm game state changes 
  
  * ### Camera
  * * Overhead third-person perspective camera
  * * Fog of war, limited/perspective
  
  * ### Environment - (WIP)
  * * Only persistent environment is player's current immediate surroundings
  * * Environment is represented as a (NxN) grid of chunks
  * * Discovered areas are randomly generated
  * * Areas previously visited will be destroyed and randomly regenerated if returned to
  * * State information of current tiles affects generation of newly generated chunks
